6. Write a program in PROLOG to implement factorial (N, F) where F represents the
factorial of a number N.
% Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
factorial(0, 1).

% Recursive case: factorial of N is N * factorial of N-1
factorial(N, F) :-
    N > 0,
    N1 is N - 1,
    factorial(N1, F1),
    F is N * F1.
Sample
?- factorial(5, F).
F = 120.
