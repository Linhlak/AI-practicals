12. Write a PROLOG program to implement two predicates evenlength(List) and
oddlength(List) so that they are true if their argument is a list of even or odd length
respectively.

% evenlength(List) is true if List has even length
evenlength([]).
evenlength([_,_|T]) :-
    evenlength(T).

% oddlength(List) is true if List has odd length
oddlength([_]).
oddlength([_,_|T]) :-
    oddlength(T).

Sample
?- evenlength([1,2,3,4]).
true.

?- oddlength([1,2,3]).
true.

?- evenlength([1,2,3]).
false.
