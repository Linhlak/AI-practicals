10. Write a PROLOG program to implement memb(X, L): to check whether X is a member
of L or not.

% Base case: X is head of the list
memb(X, [X|_]).

% Recursive case: check membership in the tail of the list
memb(X, [_|T]) :-
    memb(X, T).
Sample
?- memb(3, [1, 2, 3, 4]).
true.

?- memb(5, [1, 2, 3, 4]).
false.
