15. Write a PROLOG program to implement delete(N, L, R) that removes the element on
Nth position from a list L to generate a list R.

% Base case: remove the head (position 1)
delete(1, [_|T], T).

% Recursive case: keep the head and delete from tail
delete(N, [H|T], [H|R]) :-
    N > 1,
    N1 is N - 1,
    delete(N1, T, R).
Sample
?- delete(3, [a, b, c, d, e], R).
R = [a, b, d, e].
